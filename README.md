# React Movie Calendar

I created this web app as my first React project while learning React.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this app is to track upcoming movie premieres, so you won't miss any minor productions.

## Functionalities

### Save Upcoming Movie Dates

You can insert upcoming movies with their release dates and track them on the side panel.

### Tracking

On the left, there are two sections:

- One for movies that are already out
- One for upcoming premieres

You can also filter the movies based on the platform

### Google Account

There are two ways to save your data:

- **Anonymous** - data will be stored locally in your browser's memory
- **Google account** - data will be stored in _Firestore_ and will be accessible from any device
 
##Technologies Used
 -**React JS**
 -**CSS**
 -**Firebase**: Backend-as-a-Service, providing the database for storing movie data.
